## 📋 Quick Stats Cheat Sheet

### When to Use Each Action

| Action | Best When | Stat Threshold | Max Success |
|--------|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| 👋 **Approach** | High Friendliness | > 80 | ~70% |
| 🎁 **Treat** | Low Energy | < 40 | ~90% |
| 👀 **Observe** | High Intelligence | > 75 | ~70% |

---

## ⚠️ Critical Rules

1. **Only 2 attempts per cat** - Then they run away!
2. **Base success is only 30%** - Strategy matters!
3. **Wrong choice = 15-30% success** - Read stats carefully!
4. **Legendary cats are 50% harder** - Even with perfect strategy!
5. **Energy regenerates slowly** - 1 point every 45 seconds

---

## 🎮 Decision Tree

```
Look at Cat Stats:
├─ Friendliness > 80? → USE APPROACH (up to 70%)
├─ Energy < 40? → USE TREAT (up to 90%!)
├─ Intelligence > 75? → USE OBSERVE (up to 70%)
└─ All stats 50-70? → TOUGH CALL (~35-45%)
   └─ Pick highest stat action
```

## ⭐ Rarity Impact

| Rarity | Multiplier | Impact |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Common | 1.0× | No change |
| Uncommon | 0.95× | -5% success |
| Rare | 0.85× | -15% success |
| Epic | 0.70× | -30% success |
| **Legendary** | **0.50×** | **-50% success!** |

**Example**: Perfect strategy (70% base) on legendary = **35% final**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Read the In-Game Hints
The encounter panel shows: *"High friendliness → Approach | Low energy → Treat | High intelligence → Observe"*

### 2. Watch for Extremes
- Friendliness **85+** = Great for Approach
- Energy **30 or less** = Excellent for Treat  
- Intelligence **80+** = Perfect for Observe

### 3. Middle Stats Are Tricky
When all stats are 50-70, success rates drop to ~35-45%. Be prepared for failures.

### 4. Learn from Failures
Failed attempts give helpful hints:
- *"This cat is very friendly - try approaching!"*
- *"This cat looks tired - maybe offer a treat?"*

### 5. Second Chances
Your 2nd attempt gets +5% bonus. Use what you learned from the 1st failure!

### 6. Energy Management
- Failed encounters waste 10 energy
- Energy regenerates slowly (45 seconds per point)
- Don't rush into tough legendaries with unclear stats

## 📊 Success Rate Calculator

### Perfect Scenarios

**Common Cat + Perfect Strategy:**
- Friendliness 90 + Approach = ~50% success
- Energy 20 + Treat = ~70% success  
- Intelligence 85 + Observe = ~55% success

**Legendary Cat + Perfect Strategy:**
- Cut all the above in **half** (legendary penalty)
- Energy 20 + Treat = ~35% success (best case!)

### Worst Scenarios

**Any Cat + Wrong Strategy:**
- High Energy (80) + Treat = ~18% success
- Low Friendliness (40) + Approach = ~15% success
- Low Intelligence (45) + Observe = ~21% success

## 🎯 Collecting Strategies

### Easy Cats (Common/Uncommon)
✅ Look for one stat > 80 or < 40  
✅ Use matching action  
✅ Expect 45-70% success  
✅ Should collect in 1-2 encounters

### Medium Cats (Rare/Epic)
⚠️ Even perfect strategy = 40-60% success  
⚠️ Expect 2-3 encounters needed  
⚠️ Don't waste energy on unclear stats  
⚠️ Wait for good stat rolls

### Hard Cats (Legendary)
🔥 Perfect strategy = 30-45% success max  
🔥 Need 3-5 encounters typically  
🔥 Save energy for perfect stat matches  
🔥 First failure? Learn and adjust!  
🔥 Middle stats (50-70)? Skip and wait for better roll

## 📈 Strategy Examples

### Example 1: Easy Win
```
Persian Cat (Common)
Friendliness: 95 ⭐⭐⭐
Energy: 60
Intelligence: 55

Choice: 👋 Approach
Calculation: 30% + 15% = 45%
Rarity: × 1.0 = 45% final
Result: Good odds! Go for it!
```

### Example 2: Perfect Treat Setup
```
Ragdoll Cat (Uncommon)  
Friendliness: 70
Energy: 25 ⭐⭐⭐
Intelligence: 65

Choice: 🎁 Treat
Calculation: 50% + 15% = 65%
Rarity: × 0.95 = 62% final
Result: Best possible strategy!
```

### Example 3: Legendary Challenge
```
Bengal Cat (Legendary)
Friendliness: 50
Energy: 75
Intelligence: 85 ⭐⭐⭐

Choice: 👀 Observe
Calculation: 45% + 10% = 55%
Rarity: × 0.50 = 27.5% final
Result: Tough even with right strategy!
```

### Example 4: The Trap
```
Siamese Cat (Rare)
Friendliness: 55
Energy: 80 ❌
Intelligence: 60

DON'T: 🎁 Treat (high energy = penalty!)
Calculation: 30% × 0.6 = 18%
Rarity: × 0.85 = 15% final

DO: 👋 Approach (highest stat)
Calculation: 30% + 2.5% = 32.5%
Rarity: × 0.85 = 27.6% final
Result: Still tough, but better!
```

## 🎓 When to Retry vs Move On

### Retry Immediately If:
- ✅ Clear stat advantage (>80 or <40)
- ✅ Failed due to bad luck, not bad strategy
- ✅ Have plenty of energy (80+)
- ✅ Cat is rare+ and worth the effort

### Move On If:
- ❌ No clear stat advantages (all 50-70)
- ❌ Low on energy (<30)
- ❌ Already failed once with right strategy
- ❌ Common cat - you'll find more

## 🏆 Achievement Hunters

Some achievements got MUCH harder:

- **Master Strategist** (First try success) - Need perfect strategy + luck
- **Legendary Collection** (5 legendaries) - Very challenging!
- **Speedrun** (10 cats in 30 min) - Nearly impossible now

**Tip**: Focus on collecting all 25 breeds first, then work on challenging achievements!

---

## 🆘 Help! I'm Stuck!

### Problem: Can't collect legendaries
**Solution**: 
- Wait for perfect stat matches (>80 or <40)
- Use matching action (see cheat sheet above)
- Be patient - might take 4-5 encounters
- Remember: 2-attempt limit per encounter

### Problem: Running out of energy
**Solution**:
- Wait for regeneration (45 seconds per point)
- Don't attempt cats with unclear stats
- Focus on easier cats (common/uncommon) first
- Each failed attempt wastes 10 energy!

### Problem: Don't know which action to use
**Solution**:
- Check the in-game stats display
- Look for extreme values (very high/low)
- Use this quick reference chart
- Read failure hints after first attempt

### Problem: Keep failing even with "right" strategy
**Solution**:
- Remember: even perfect strategy isn't 100%!
- Success rates are 30-70% at best (70-90% for low-energy treats)
- Legendary cats are particularly tough (50% penalty)
- This is normal - be persistent!
