# Layout Fix - Collection Panel Visibility (v2.0.3)

## Problem

The collection panel was always visible on the page, pushing the control buttons down and potentially hiding them below the fold. This made it unclear what actions the player could take, especially for new users.

## Root Cause

- `#collection-panel` was always displayed (no `display: none` default)
- The panel contained 25 cat cards (even if locked), taking up significant vertical space
- Controls were pushed below the collection, requiring scrolling to see them
- New players couldn't see the "Explore for Cats" button without scrolling

## Solution

### 1. Hide Collection by Default

**File**: `styles.css`

```css
#collection-panel {
    /* ... existing styles ... */
    display: none; /* Hidden by default */
}

#collection-panel.visible {
    display: block; /* Show when toggled */
}
```

### 2. Toggle Collection Visibility

**File**: `game.js` - `scrollToCollection()` function

Changed from:

- Simple scroll to collection

To:

- Toggle `.visible` class on collection panel
- Update button text: "📚 View Collection" ↔ "📚 Hide Collection"
- Smooth scroll when opening (not when closing)

### 3. Enhanced Controls Visibility

**File**: `styles.css` - `#controls`

Added:

- Warm gradient background (`#fff9c4` → `#ffe0b2`)
- Border and shadow for prominence
- Increased padding (5px → 20px vertical)
- Added margin for breathing room
- Clear visual separation from other content

## User Experience Impact

### Before

```
[Game Canvas]
[Huge Collection Panel with 25 cards] ← Always visible
[Controls - might be below fold] ← Hard to see
```

### After

```
[Game Canvas]
[Prominent Controls in golden box] ← Immediately visible
[Collection Panel] ← Only shown when "View Collection" clicked
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Action Clarity**
   - Controls are now prominently displayed right after the canvas
   - Golden "Explore for Cats" button is unmissable
   - No scrolling required to start playing

2. **Clean Layout**
   - Less visual clutter on initial load
   - Collection only shows when requested
   - Better use of screen real estate

3. **Toggle Functionality**
   - Click "View Collection" to see all cats
   - Click "Hide Collection" to collapse it
   - Button text updates to show current state

4. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - Controls in warm gradient box stand out
   - Clear separation between game elements
   - Natural eye flow: Canvas → Controls → (Optional) Collection

## Technical Details

### CSS Classes

- `.visible` - Added to `#collection-panel` when shown
- Default: `display: none`
- Toggle: `display: block`

### JavaScript

```javascript
function scrollToCollection() {
    const collectionPanel = document.getElementById('collection-panel');
    const collectionBtn = document.getElementById('collection-btn');
    
    if (collectionPanel.classList.contains('visible')) {
        // Hide collection
        collectionPanel.classList.remove('visible');
        collectionBtn.textContent = '📚 View Collection';
    } else {
        // Show collection
        collectionPanel.classList.add('visible');
        collectionBtn.textContent = '📚 Hide Collection';
        // Scroll to it after transition
        setTimeout(() => {
            collectionPanel.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
        }, 100);
    }
}
```
