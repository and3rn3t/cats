# Bug Fix: Layout Overlap Issues

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Version**: 2.6.1b (patch)  
**Type**: Layout Fix  

---

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Environment Cards Covering Canvas Content

**Problem:**

- Environment selector cards were overlapping the game canvas
- The instruction text "👇 Click 'Explore for Cats' below! 👇" at the bottom of the canvas was being covered
- The collection progress text "4 / 25 cats collected!" in the canvas was partially obscured
- Controls navigation bar was also overlapping the canvas area

**Root Cause:**

- No z-index values set on game sections
- No proper spacing between canvas and environment selector
- Canvas text positioned too close to the bottom edge
- Layout sections not using `clear: both` or proper positioning

**Visual Evidence:**

- Screenshot showed green banner with "4 / 25 cats collected!" partially covered by environment cards
- Navigation buttons (Explore for Cats, Hide Collection, etc.) overlapping content above

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Z-Index Hierarchy

**CSS Changes:**

```css
/* Game screen - base layer */
#game-screen {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 1;
    margin-bottom: var(--space-md);
}

/* Environment selector - middle layer */
#environment-selector {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 2;
    clear: both;
}

/* Controls - upper layer */
#controls {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 3;
    clear: both;
}

/* Collection panel - highest when visible */
#collection-panel {
    position: relative;
    z-index: 100; /* High z-index when visible */
}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Creates clear visual hierarchy
- Prevents overlapping
- `clear: both` ensures sections don't float over each other
- Collection panel at z-index 100 to overlay everything when toggled

### 2. Added Proper Spacing

**CSS Changes:**

```css
#game-screen {
    margin-bottom: var(--space-md); /* Add space below canvas */
}

#environment-selector {
    margin: var(--space-lg) 0; /* Maintains existing spacing */
}

#controls {
    margin: 20px 0; /* Maintains existing spacing */
}
```

### 3. Updated Canvas Text Positioning

**JavaScript Changes - `game.js`:**

**Before:**

```javascript
// Instruction text - positioned at y: canvas.height - 25
ctx.fillText('👇 Click "Explore for Cats" below! 👇', canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 25);

// Collection progress
ctx.fillText(`${gameState.collectedCats.size} / 25 cats collected!`, canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2 + 20);
```

**After:**

```javascript
// Instruction text - positioned higher at y: canvas.height - 15
ctx.fillText('👇 Press "Explore for Cats" below to start! 👇', canvas.width / 2, canvas.height - 15);

// Collection progress - larger font, updated cat count
ctx.font = 'bold 18px "Comic Sans MS"'; // Increased from 16px
ctx.fillText(`${gameState.collectedCats.size} / 40 cats collected!`, canvas.width / 2, canvas.height / 2 + 20);
```

**Changes:**

- Moved instruction text 10px higher (from -25 to -15)
- Changed "Click" to "Press" for consistency
- Updated cat count from 25 to 40 (matches v2.5.0 content)
- Increased collection progress font from 16px to 18px (more visible)
- Added "to start!" for clarity

### 4. Updated Cache Versions

**HTML Changes:**

```html
<!-- Force browser cache refresh -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css?v=2.6.1b">
<script src="game.js?v=2.6.1b"></script>
```

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Z-Index Strategy

**Layering System:**

1. **Game Screen (z-index: 1)** - Base layer
2. **Environment Selector (z-index: 2)** - Middle layer
3. **Controls (z-index: 3)** - Upper layer
4. **Collection Panel (z-index: 100)** - Overlay layer (when visible)
5. **Loading Overlay (z-index: 10000)** - Top-most layer

**Reasoning:**

- Low z-indexes for static content
- High z-index for modal/overlay content
- Clear separation prevents conflicts
- Future-proof for additional layers

### Canvas Text Positioning

**Y-Position Calculation:**

- Top title: `y = 35` (fixed position)
- Middle text: `y = canvas.height / 2 + 20` (center + offset)
- Bottom text: `y = canvas.height - 15` (near bottom with margin)

**Margins:**

- Top: 35px from top edge
- Bottom: 15px from bottom edge (increased from 25px for more visibility)
- Prevents text from being too close to canvas edge

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Z-Index Management**: Always establish z-index hierarchy for complex layouts
2. **Visual Testing**: Test on actual rendered page, not just in code
3. **Spacing Matters**: Proper margins prevent overlapping even with z-index
4. **Content Updates**: Keep text synchronized with current feature set (25 → 40 cats)
5. **Canvas Text**: Leave adequate margins from canvas edges for visibility
6. **Clear Property**: Use `clear: both` to prevent float-related overlaps

- Keyboard navigation unaffected
- Screen reader flow remains logical
- Focus management unchanged

### Improved

## 📝 Future Recommendations

1. **Layout Audit**: Review all major sections for potential overlap
2. **Z-Index Documentation**: Maintain a z-index reference guide
3. **Spacing System**: Consider more consistent spacing variables
4. **Canvas Sizing**: Evaluate if canvas height is adequate for content
5. **Responsive Testing**: Ensure fixes work on various screen sizes
