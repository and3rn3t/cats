## üìã Next Steps (Remaining Work)

### Step 2: Cat Breeds Distribution & Addition (Est. 60 min)

#### A. Update Existing 25 Cats with Environments

Need to add `environment` property to all current cats in `catData.js`:

**Forest (8 cats)**: IDs 1-8

- Siamese, Maine Coon, Persian, Bengal, Ragdoll, Sphynx, British Shorthair, Abyssinian

**Mountain (5 cats)**: IDs reassign from existing

- Norwegian Forest Cat, Siberian, Turkish Angora, Russian Blue, Manx

**Desert (6 cats)**: IDs reassign from existing  

- Egyptian Mau, Turkish Van, Somali, Burmese

**City (3 cats)**: IDs reassign from existing

- American Shorthair, Scottish Fold, Oriental

**Beach (3 cats)**: IDs reassign from existing

- Balinese, Tonkinese, Javanese

#### B. Add 15 New Cat Breeds (IDs 26-40)

Research and add breeds appropriate for each environment to reach 40 total with 8 cats per environment.

**Target Distribution**:

- Forest: 8 cats (existing + new)
- Mountain: 8 cats (existing + new)
- Desert: 8 cats (existing + new)
- City: 8 cats (existing + new)
- Beach: 8 cats (existing + new)

**Rarity Balance** (40 total):

- Common (40%): 16 cats
- Uncommon (30%): 12 cats
- Rare (20%): 8 cats
- Epic (8%): 3 cats
- Legendary (2%): 1 cat

### Step 3: Game Logic Integration (Est. 45 min)

#### game.js Updates

- [ ] Import and initialize environment system
- [ ] Filter `findCat()` to only return cats from current environment
- [ ] Check for environment unlocks after each collection
- [ ] Show environment unlock notifications
- [ ] Initialize `currentEnvironment: 'forest'` in gameState
- [ ] Add `unlockedEnvironments: new Set(['forest'])` to gameState
- [ ] Call `renderEnvironmentSelector()` in `initGame()`
- [ ] Update total cats count from 25 to 40

#### visuals.js Updates  

- [ ] Update `drawGame()` to use environment-specific backgrounds
- [ ] Add `drawEnvironmentBackground(ctx, environmentId)` function
- [ ] Use environment gradient colors from ENVIRONMENTS
- [ ] Add environment-specific visual elements (optional)

### Step 4: Achievement System Expansion (Est. 45 min)

#### achievements.js Updates

- [ ] Add 19 new achievements:
  - 5 Mini-game achievements
  - 5 Environment completion achievements
  - 4 Collection milestones (20, 30, 40 cats + environment master)
  - 3 Exploration achievements
  - 2 Social achievements

- [ ] Add helper functions:

  ```javascript
  function checkEnvironmentComplete(state, environment)
  function checkAllEnvironmentsComplete(state)
  function checkHighScore(state, threshold)
  function checkEnergyEfficiency(state)
  function checkCatsFromAllEnvironments(state)
  ```

- [ ] Update existing continent mapping for new cat origins

#### Game State Tracking

- [ ] Add to gameState:
  - `minigamesPlayed: 0`
  - `longestSuccessStreak: 0`
  - `currentSuccessStreak: 0`
  - `energyHistory: []`

- [ ] Track in minigames.js:
  - Increment `minigamesPlayed` when game starts

- [ ] Track in game.js:
  - Success streaks in `handleEncounterAction()`
  - Energy history for efficiency tracking

### Step 5: Testing & Polish (Est. 30 min)

#### Functionality Testing

- [ ] All 40 cats can be collected
- [ ] Environment switching works smoothly
- [ ] Environment unlocks trigger correctly
- [ ] Cats only appear in their designated environments
- [ ] All achievements can be unlocked
- [ ] Save/load preserves environment state
- [ ] UI is responsive on mobile

#### Visual Testing

- [ ] Environment cards display correctly
- [ ] Active environment highlighted properly
- [ ] Locked environments show correctly
- [ ] Progress bars update accurately
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] Colors and gradients look good

#### Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Screen reader announcements
- [ ] ARIA labels present
- [ ] Focus indicators visible

### Step 6: Documentation (Est. 20 min)

#### Files to Update

- [ ] **README.md**: Update cat count (25 ‚Üí 40), mention 5 environments
- [ ] **CHANGELOG.md**: Add v2.5.0 entry with all changes
- [ ] **docs/ROADMAP.md**: Mark Phase 2.3-2.5 as complete
- [ ] **docs/API.md**: Document environments.js API
- [ ] **docs/QUICKSTART.md**: Mention environment system

#### New Documentation

- [ ] Finalize `docs/PHASE_2.3-2.5_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- [ ] Add cat breed research notes
- [ ] Add environment design notes

## üéØ Immediate Next Action

**Continue with Step 2A**: Update existing 25 cats with environment assignments

This involves:

1. Reading through current catData.js
2. Logically assigning each of the 25 cats to appropriate environments
3. Adding `environment: 'forest'|'mountain'|'desert'|'city'|'beach'` property
4. Ensuring balanced rarity distribution across environments

## üìä Completion Status

| Step | Task | Status | Time |
|------|------|--------|------|
| 1 | Infrastructure | ‚úÖ Complete | 30 min |
| 2 | Cat Breeds | üîÑ Next | 60 min |
| 3 | Game Logic | ‚è≥ Pending | 45 min |
| 4 | Achievements | ‚è≥ Pending | 45 min |
| 5 | Testing | ‚è≥ Pending | 30 min |
| 6 | Documentation | ‚è≥ Pending | 20 min |

**Total Progress**: 15% Complete (Step 1 of 6)  
**Estimated Remaining Time**: ~3 hours

## üîß Technical Notes

### Environment ID Assignment Strategy

The cat distribution should follow real-world logic:

- **Forest**: Natural wild cats, woodland dwellers
- **Mountain**: Cold-weather cats, high-altitude breeds
- **Desert**: Heat-adapted cats, Middle Eastern/African breeds
- **City**: Domestic breeds, street-smart cats, urban dwellers
- **Beach**: Tropical breeds, island cats, coastal varieties

### Rarity Distribution Per Environment

Each environment should have:

- 3-4 Common cats
- 2-3 Uncommon cats
- 1-2 Rare cats
- 0-1 Epic cats
- 0-1 Legendary cats (only 1 legendary total in game)

### Save Game Compatibility

The new `currentEnvironment` and `unlockedEnvironments` properties will be added to game State with sensible defaults, so existing saves will work seamlessly.
