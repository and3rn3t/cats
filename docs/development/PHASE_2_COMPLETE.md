## 🎯 What's Next: Phase 3 - Code Quality

Now that all content features are complete, it's time to focus on **code quality and maintainability**.

### Phase 3 Priorities

#### 3.1 Refactor `handleEncounterAction()` 🔴 HIGH PRIORITY

**Current State:**
- 280+ lines in single function
- Cognitive complexity: 50 (limit: 15)
- Hard to maintain and test

**Plan:**
- Break into smaller functions:
  - `calculateSuccess(cat, action)`
  - `processSuccess(cat, action)`
  - `processFailure(cat, action, attemptNumber)`
  - `generateStrategyFeedback(cat, action, success)`
  - `calculateAttemptBonus(attemptNumber)`
- Add unit tests
- Document each function

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

#### 3.2 Clean Up Complexity Warnings

**Files with Cognitive Complexity Issues:**

1. `minigames.js` - `handleSeekClick()` (complexity 16/15)
2. `environments.js` - `renderEnvironmentSelector()` (complexity 16/15)

**Plan:**
- Extract helper functions
- Simplify conditional logic
- Add early returns

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

#### 3.3 Complete CSS Variable Conversion 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Current State:**
- 80% converted to CSS variables
- 20% still hardcoded

**Plan:**
- Convert remaining hardcoded values
- Document intentional exceptions
- Ensure 100% design system compliance

**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

#### 3.4 Clean Up Markdown Linting 🟢 LOW PRIORITY

**Current Issues:**
- Missing blank lines around lists
- Missing blank lines around headings
- Duplicate headings in CHANGELOG

**Plan:**
- Fix markdown formatting
- Standardize documentation structure

**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

---

## 💡 Recommended Order for Phase 3

1. **Start**: Refactor `handleEncounterAction()` (biggest impact)
2. **Then**: Fix complexity warnings in minigames/environments
3. **Then**: Complete CSS variable conversion
4. **Finally**: Clean up markdown linting

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## 🎉 Celebration Time!

### What We've Accomplished

Phase 2 is **complete**! The game has grown from a simple cat collector into a rich, engaging experience with:

- Multiple environments to explore
- Dozens of cats to discover
- Mini-games for endless fun
- Immersive sound effects
- Achievements to unlock

The game is now **feature-complete** for the content roadmap. All that remains is code quality improvements to ensure long-term maintainability.

## 📝 Files Ready for Phase 3

### Files Needing Refactoring

1. `game.js` - `handleEncounterAction()` function
2. `minigames.js` - `handleSeekClick()` function
3. `environments.js` - `renderEnvironmentSelector()` function
4. `styles.css` - Remaining hardcoded values

### Files in Good Shape ✅

- `audio.js` - Clean, modular, well-documented
- `achievements.js` - Just updated, clean structure
- `catData.js` - Data file, no logic issues
- `visuals.js` - Canvas rendering, efficient
- `analytics.js` - Simple tracking, no issues
