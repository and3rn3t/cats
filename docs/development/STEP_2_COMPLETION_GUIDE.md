# Step 2 Completion Guide - Cat Breed Updates

## Quick Implementation Script

Run this Python script to complete Step 2A (add environment to existing cats):

```python
import re

# Environment mapping for existing 25 cats
ENV_MAP = {
    1: 'forest',   # Persian
    2: 'desert',   # Siamese  
    3: 'forest',   # Maine Coon
    4: 'city',     # Bengal
    5: 'city',     # Scottish Fold
    6: 'beach',    # Sphynx
    7: 'forest',   # Ragdoll
    8: 'city',     # British Shorthair
    9: 'desert',   # Abyssinian
    10: 'mountain', # Russian Blue
    11: 'forest',  # Norwegian Forest Cat
    12: 'forest',  # Birman
    13: 'mountain', # Turkish Angora
    14: 'city',    # Manx
    15: 'desert',  # Egyptian Mau
    16: 'desert',  # Burmese
    17: 'beach',   # Savannah
    18: 'forest',  # Chartreux
    19: 'beach',   # Tonkinese
    20: 'city',    # Devon Rex
    21: 'beach',   # Ocicat
    22: 'forest',  # Japanese Bobtail
    23: 'mountain', # Himalayan
    24: 'beach',   # Singapura
    25: 'beach'    # Exotic Shorthair
}

with open('catData.js', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()

new_lines = []
current_id = None

for i, line in enumerate(lines):
    new_lines.append(line)
    
    # Detect cat ID
    id_match = re.match(r'\s+id:\s+(\d+),', line)
    if id_match:
        current_id = int(id_match.group(1))
    
    # Add environment after origin line
    if current_id and re.match(r'\s+origin:', line):
        env = ENV_MAP.get(current_id, 'forest')
        indent = ' ' * 8
        new_lines.append(f'{indent}environment: "{env}",\n')
        current_id = None  # Reset

# Update header
new_content = ''.join(new_lines)
new_content = new_content.replace('25+ Unique Breeds', '40 Unique Breeds across 5 Environments')

with open('catData.js', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(new_content)

print("‚úÖ Added environment property to all 25 cats")
```

## Step 2B: Add 15 New Cat Breeds

Append these to the end of CAT_BREEDS array (before the closing `];`):

```

## Step 2C: Update environments.js Cat ID Arrays

Update the `catIds` arrays in environments.js to match the final distribution:

```javascript
forest: {
    // ... other properties
    catIds: [1, 3, 7, 11, 12, 18, 22, 26]
},
mountain: {
    // ... other properties  
    catIds: [10, 13, 23, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
},
desert: {
    // ... other properties
    catIds: [2, 9, 15, 16, 32, 33, 34, 35]
},
city: {
    // ... other properties
    catIds: [4, 5, 8, 14, 20, 36, 37, 38]
},
beach: {
    // ... other properties
    catIds: [6, 17, 19, 21, 24, 25, 39, 40]
}
```

## Verification Checklist

After completing the above:

- [ ] 40 total cats in CAT_BREEDS array
- [ ] All cats have `environment` property
- [ ] IDs 1-40 are sequential
- [ ] Rarity distribution: 16 common, 12 uncommon, 8 rare, 3 epic, 1 legendary
- [ ] Each environment has exactly 8 cats
- [ ] environments.js catIds arrays match cat environments
- [ ] No syntax errors in catData.js

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check cat count
Select-String -Path catData.js -Pattern "^\s+id:" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count

# Check environment properties
Select-String -Path catData.js -Pattern "environment:" | Measure-Object | Select-Object Count

# Check for syntax errors
node -c catData.js
```

**Next**: Once Step 2 is complete, proceed to Step 3 (Game Logic Integration)
