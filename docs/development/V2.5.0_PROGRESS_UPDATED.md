## üìã Step 3: Game Logic Integration (Next - Est. 45 min)

**This is what we'll do next!**

### 3.1 Update game.js Core Functions

#### A. Import & Initialize Environments

```javascript
// At top of game.js
let currentEnvironment = 'forest'; // Start in forest
let environmentProgress = {
    forest: { discovered: new Set(), visits: 0 },
    mountain: { discovered: new Set(), visits: 0 },
    desert: { discovered: new Set(), visits: 0 },
    city: { discovered: new Set(), visits: 0 },
    beach: { discovered: new Set(), visits: 0 }
};
```

#### B. Filter findCat() by Environment

```javascript
function findCat() {
    // Filter cats by current environment
    const availableCats = CAT_BREEDS.filter(cat => 
        cat.environment === currentEnvironment
    );
    
    // Existing rarity logic...
    // Select from availableCats instead of CAT_BREEDS
}
```

#### C. Update Collection Display

- Add environment badge/icon to each cat card
- Group cats by environment in collection
- Show per-environment progress (X/8 collected)

#### D. Environment Switching

- Hook up environment selector buttons
- Update UI when environment changes
- Show unlock status and requirements
- Trigger unlock notifications

### 3.2 Update Achievements System

Add new achievement categories:

- **Environment Explorer**: Discover first cat in each environment
- **Forest Master**: Collect all 8 forest cats
- **Mountain Master**: Collect all 8 mountain cats
- **Desert Master**: Collect all 8 desert cats
- **City Master**: Collect all 8 city cats
- **Beach Master**: Collect all 8 beach cats
- **World Traveler**: Unlock all 5 environments
- **Ultimate Collector**: Collect all 40 cats

### 3.3 Save/Load Updates

Extend save data structure:

```javascript
{
    version: "2.5.0",
    currentEnvironment: "forest",
    environmentProgress: { ... },
    environmentsUnlocked: ["forest"],
    collectedCats: [...],
    // existing fields...
}
```

Handle migration from old saves (v2.4.0 ‚Üí v2.5.0)

### 3.4 UI Polish

- Environment unlock notifications
- Visual feedback for environment switching
- Progress indicators per environment
- Cat card environment badges
- Help text explaining environments

4. **Add environment switching function**
5. **Test**: Verify cats only appear from current environment

### Phase B: UI Integration (15 min)

1. **Hook up environment selector buttons**
2. **Add environment badges to cat cards**
3. **Update collection panel** to show per-environment progress
4. **Add environment info to cat detail modal**
5. **Test**: Switch environments and verify UI updates

### Phase C: Save/Load (10 min)

1. **Update save data structure**
2. **Add environment state to saveGame()**
3. **Update loadGame()** with migration logic
4. **Test**: Save, reload, verify environment persists
