## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### `achievements.js` (~80 lines added)

**New Helper Functions:**

```javascript
/**
 * Check if all cats from a specific environment are collected
 */
function checkEnvironmentComplete(state, environmentId)

/**
 * Check if any mini-game high score meets or exceeds threshold
 */
function checkAnyHighScore(state, threshold)

/**
 * Check specific mini-game high score
 */
function checkMinigameHighScore(state, gameName, threshold)
```

**Updated Achievements Array:**
- Expanded from 20 to 36 total achievements
- All new achievements properly categorized by rarity
- Used optional chaining (`?.`) for safe property access
- Added requirements that check gameState for environment and mini-game data

#### `minigames.js` (~30 lines modified)

**Added Games Played Tracking:**

```javascript
const minigameState = {
    // ... existing properties
    gamesPlayed: 0  // NEW: Tracks total games played
};
```

**Updated Game Over Functions:**
- `treatGameOver()` - Increments `gamesPlayed` counter
- `chaseGameOver()` - Increments `gamesPlayed` counter
- `seekGameOver()` - Increments `gamesPlayed` counter

**Enhanced Save Function:**

```javascript
function saveMinigameScores() {
    // Save to localStorage
    localStorage.setItem('catCollectorMinigames', JSON.stringify({
        highScores: minigameState.highScores,
        gamesPlayed: minigameState.gamesPlayed  // NEW
    }));
    
    // Sync to main gameState for achievements (NEW)
    if (window.gameState) {
        window.gameState.minigameHighScores = minigameState.highScores;
        window.gameState.minigamesPlayed = minigameState.gamesPlayed;
        
        // Trigger save and achievement check
        if (window.saveGame) window.saveGame();
        if (window.updateAchievements) {
            window.updateAchievements(window.gameState);
        }

## 🔄 Integration with Existing Systems

### Environment System
Achievement checks now reference `state.unlockedEnvironments` Set to determine which environments the player has unlocked.

```javascript
// Example: Check if Mountain is unlocked
requirement: (state) => state.unlockedEnvironments?.has('mountain') || false
```

### Mini-Game System
Achievement checks now reference `state.minigameHighScores` and `state.minigamesPlayed` which are automatically synced from the mini-game system.

```javascript
// Example: Check if player has played 10+ games
requirement: (state) => (state.minigamesPlayed || 0) >= 10
```

### Cat Collection System
Uses existing `ENVIRONMENTS` global object to check if all cats from a specific environment have been collected.

```javascript
// Example: Check if all Forest cats are collected
function checkEnvironmentComplete(state, 'forest') {
    const env = window.ENVIRONMENTS['forest'];
    return env.catIds.every(catId => state.collectedCats.has(catId));
}
```
