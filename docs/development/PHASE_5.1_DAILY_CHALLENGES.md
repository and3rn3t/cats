## üîß Technical Implementation

### New File: `challenges.js` (607 lines)

**Key Functions**:

```javascript
// Initialization
initializeChallenges(state)
generateDailyChallenges(state)

// Progress Tracking
updateChallengeProgress(state, eventType, eventData)
completeChallenge(state, challenge)

// Streak Management
updateStreak(state)
getTodayDateString()
getYesterdayDateString()

// UI Rendering
renderChallengesPanel(state)
showChallengeNotification(challenge)
openChallenges(state)
closeChallenges()

// Utilities
formatChallengeDescription(template, variant)
hashCode(str)
seededRandom(seed)
```

### Integration Points

**game.js Updates**:

1. **Initialization** (in `initGame()`):
   ```javascript
   if (window.initializeChallenges) {
       initializeChallenges(gameState);
       generateDailyChallenges(gameState);
   }
   ```

2. **Event Tracking**:
   - `exploreForCats()`: Track explorations
   - `processSuccessfulEncounter()`: Track cat collection
   - `handleEncounterAction()`: Track action successes/failures
   
3. **Button Handler**:
   ```javascript
   document.getElementById('challenges-btn')?.addEventListener('click', () => {
       if (window.openChallenges) {
           openChallenges(gameState);
       }
   });
   ```

4. **Save/Load**:
   - Serializes `dailyChallenges` to localStorage
   - Converts Sets to Arrays for JSON
   - Loads and restores challenge state

**minigames.js Update**:
- Tracks mini-game plays in `startMinigame()`

### Data Structure

```javascript
