## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-03 - "Challenge Mode" 🎯

### 🔥 MAJOR GAMEPLAY OVERHAUL

This version completely transforms Cat Collector from a casual clicking game into a strategic puzzle game with meaningful choices and real consequences!

### ✨ Added

- **Strategic Success Rate Calculation**:
  - Base success reduced from 50% to 30%
  - Optimal strategy bonuses based on stat matching (up to +40% for perfect treat scenarios)
  - Harsh penalties for wrong choices (success rates as low as 15-21%)
  - Stat thresholds for optimal strategies:
    - Friendliness > 80 → Best for Approach
    - Energy < 40 → Best for Treat (highest success potential!)
    - Intelligence > 75 → Best for Observe
- **Rarity Difficulty Multipliers**:
  - Common: 1.0× (no change)
  - Uncommon: 0.95× (-5%)
  - Rare: 0.85× (-15%)
  - Epic: 0.70× (-30%)
  - Legendary: 0.50× (-50%!) Makes legendaries VERY challenging!
- **Strategic Feedback System**:
  - Success messages indicate strategy quality ("EXCELLENT STRATEGY!" vs "Lucky!")
  - Failure messages provide helpful hints based on cat stats
  - Contextual advice teaches optimal strategies
- **Second Attempt Bonus**: Small +5% bonus on second attempt to reward persistence
- **Comprehensive Stats Display**: Encounter panel now shows all 4 key stats in a formatted grid with strategy tips
- **In-Game Strategy Hints**: Tooltip showing stat-to-action mapping directly in encounters
- **Updated Help Documentation**: Complete rewrite of strategy sections explaining new mechanics

### ⚙️ Changed

- **Energy Regeneration**: Slowed from 30 seconds to 45 seconds per energy point (50% slower)
- **Success Calculation Logic**: Complete rewrite of `handleEncounterAction()` function (~280 lines of new difficulty logic)
- **Encounter Display**: Enhanced `showEncounter()` with detailed stat visualization
- **Help Modal**: Rewrote strategy sections with specific stat thresholds and warnings

### 📊 Balance Impact

**Before v2.1.0**:

- Unlimited attempts per cat
- 50% base success + easy bonuses
- Most encounters succeeded with any choice
- Energy regenerated quickly
- All 25 cats collectible in ~30 minutes
- Difficulty: ⭐☆☆☆☆ (1/5)

**After v2.1.0**:

- Only 2 attempts per cat
- 30% base success with strategic modifiers
- Wrong choices fail 70-85% of the time
- Energy is more scarce resource
- All 25 cats require 2-4 hours with good strategy
- Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

### 🎓 Player Experience Changes

- "Speedrun Champion" (10 cats in 30 min) - Nearly impossible now

### 🐛 Known Considerations

- Legendary cats can take 3-5 encounters to collect even with perfect strategy
- Middle stat values (50-70) create tough decisions with ~35-45% success
- Energy scarcity is intentional - failed encounters should hurt
