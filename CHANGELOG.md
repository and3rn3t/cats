## [2.1.0] - 2024-10-03 - "Challenge Mode" üéØ

### üî• MAJOR GAMEPLAY OVERHAUL

This version completely transforms Cat Collector from a casual clicking game into a strategic puzzle game with meaningful choices and real consequences!

  - Success messages indicate strategy quality ("EXCELLENT STRATEGY!" vs "Lucky!")
  - Failure messages provide helpful hints based on cat stats
  - Contextual advice teaches optimal strategies
- **Second Attempt Bonus**: Small +5% bonus on second attempt to reward persistence
- **Comprehensive Stats Display**: Encounter panel now shows all 4 key stats in a formatted grid with strategy tips
- **In-Game Strategy Hints**: Tooltip showing stat-to-action mapping directly in encounters

- **Encounter Display**: Enhanced `showEncounter()` with detailed stat visualization
- **Help Modal**: Rewrote strategy sections with specific stat thresholds and warnings

### üìä Balance Impact

**Before v2.1.0**:

- Unlimited attempts per cat
- 50% base success + easy bonuses
- Most encounters succeeded with any choice
- Energy regenerated quickly
- All 25 cats collectible in ~30 minutes
- Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ (1/5)

**After v2.1.0**:

- Only 2 attempts per cat
- 30% base success with strategic modifiers
- Wrong choices fail 70-85% of the time

- All 25 cats require 2-4 hours with good strategy
- Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚òÜ (4/5)
